# Acoustics Toolbox Fork

This is essentially a fork of the Acoustics Toolbox developed by the HLS Research group.
Since there is no official repository of the source code, this repository does
not contain any history beyond changes made locally. The original work was licensed
by GNU v3, with the original statement included inside the [original README](README_orig.md).

To read the original information that came with this toolbox, please read
the [original README](README_orig.md). It has instructions and information about the
code that will not be repeated here.
