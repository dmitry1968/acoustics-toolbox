# Acoustics Toolbox BYU Fork

This is essentially a fork of the Acoustics Toolbox developed by the HLS Research group.
Since there is no official repository of the source code, this repository does
not contain any history beyond changes made by BYU.

To read the original information that came with this toolbox, please read
the [original README](README_orig.md). It has instructions and information about the
code that will not be repeated here.

## Changes Made For BYU

Basic repository set-up, including a README, a LICENSE, and a `.gitignore` file.

Stay tuned for more.
